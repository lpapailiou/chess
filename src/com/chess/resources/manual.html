		<h2>Before the game starts</h2>
		<p>Before your game starts, you will get some fancy options
		to adjust the gameplay. Let's go through from top to bottom.</p>

		<div>
			<p class="txt-col-medium">
			Okay, thing is: the white pieces always start. Never mind. If 'white' 
			is chosen, the white pieces will start at the bottom and play upwards, the black pieces start from top and play to the bottom. 
			If 'black' is chosen, <i>vice versa</i> that thing.

			<ul class="txt-col-medium">
				<li><b>touched/moved: </b>now, if this guy is on, you will be forced to move a chess piece if you touched it before. No 'ah no, let's try another maybe'.</li>
				<li><b>en passant: </b>special pawn hit - better check rules on this one.</li>
				<li><b>timeout: </b>this guy will end the game if a board situation happens about three times or 50 irrelevant moves are made.</li>

			Now it gets interesting. This option lets you play with the ai. If you like, you can also play with a friend on the same computer (of course you <i>have</i> friends).

			Wow... now you know there's an ai (WOW). It might be smarter than you. Good for you that we thought about that already. We want to make you happy, so

			<p class="txt-col-wider">
			In case you would like to load an existing game, use this nice little button here. Clicking it will open a dialog, where you can either enter a FEN or PGN code or upload a PGN file. Nice.

		<h2>During the game</h2>
		<p>How exciting! Now we're ready to play! <br> Okay I guess you know how a chess board looks like. Let's have a look at the other stuff.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_game.png" alt="game screen">
	</div>

	<div class="halfbox">
		<h3>the menu</h3>
		<div class="img-col-small">
			<img src="chess_screenshots_game_game.png" alt="game screen: game menu">
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="txt-col-small"><b>Game menu:</b> New stuff here! Click on 'new game' to go back to the settings screen. 
			Here you will get new fancy choices. Your running game will be trashed though. If you want a new game with the current settings, 
			just click on 'restart game'. <br><br>
			In the middle section, we have options to copy the FEN or PGN code of your current game directly to your clipboard.<br>
			Alternatively, you can of course also export a PGN file (will go to your temp files).<br>
			If you click 'copy board', a screenshot of the board will be clipped to your clipboard.<br><br>
			Or quit. Like a quitter.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="img-col-small">
			<img src="chess_screenshots_game_edit.png" alt="game screen: editing menu">
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="txt-col-small"><b>Edit menu:</b> Here you can rotate the board, if the game is not confusing enough for you already.<br><br>
			AND, there is an edit mode. WOW. We'll get back to that later.</p>
		</div>	
		<div class="img-col-small">
			<img src="chess_screenshots_game_help.png" alt="game screen: help menu">
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="txt-col-small"><b>Help menu:</b> The dummy mode will highlight the fields a piece can go to, as soon as you touch it.<br><br>
			Apart from this pretty manual and the chess rules, you can also have a look at the moves of the current game by using 'Show moves'.</p>
		</div>	
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>the status bar</h3>
		<div>
			<img src="chess_screenshots_game_status.png" alt="game screen: status bar">
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="p-wide">
			In case you forget if it's your turn or not, this guy will show you. He will let you also know when you lost and how many moves were made. 
			<br><b>Pro tip:</b> click on the status label to see the last move flashing up. If you want to see which pieces you can move, click on the status text.
			<br>Also: chess moves are counted as 'half moves'.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>the edit mode</h3>
		<div>
			<img src="chess_screenshots_game_editMode.png" alt="game screen: edit mode">
		</div>
		<div>
			<p class="p-wide">
			Look at this. You can also edit your moves (or analyze the game) by using this nice feature. </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>pause: </b>hit this and editing will be enabled.</li>
				<li><b>play: </b>this one basically means 'resume game', so the edit mode will be blocked. It will also clear future moves in case there were some.</li>
				
				<li><b>step back: </b>step back.</li>
				<li><b>step forward: </b>step forward. Get it?</li>
				<li><b>speed: </b>have a little control over the speed. This will only make sense if a bot is active.</li>
			</ul>
			
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h2>The gameplay</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
			Whoopsie. Remembered you dont know how to play yet. You basically have two possibilites:
			<ul>
				<li><b>click: </b>click the piece you want to move and then click on the field you want to go to.</li>
				<li><b>drag'n'drop: </b>drag the piece you like to the field you like. Simple as that.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h3>show hints</h3>
		<div>
			<p class="p-wide">
			One more thing: if you forgot how this game works and feel too lazy about having a look at the rules, just right-click on one of your pieces, then some nice hints will flash up.
