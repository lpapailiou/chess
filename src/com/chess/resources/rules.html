	<h1>Following rules are implemented:</h1>
	
	<h2>General rule sets</h2>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_start.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<h3>start of the game</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>player with white pieces starts.</li>
			<li>the start situation will determine the move direction of pieces. (specifically pawns)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="halfbox">
		<h3>during the game</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>a piece can be hit if another piece is moved onto that specific field. (exception: en passant move)</li>
			<li>if the player picks up a piece, he is forced to make a move with this piece. (this rule can be disabled)</li>
			<li><b>CHECK: </b>if a king is endangered by his opponent, he is forced to get out of that situation.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<h3>end of the game</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>CHECKMATE: </b>the game ends with a winner, if - during the next move - the king of the other player would be killed.</li>
			<li><b>STALEMATE: </b>if no valid moves are possible and the king is not in check, the game ends with a draw.</li>
			<li><b>REMIS: </b>if too many meaningless moves (50 moves without a kill and no pawn moved or same position 3 times repeated) are made, the game will end with a draw. (this rule can be disabled)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Moves by piece</h2>
	<h3>pawns</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_pawns.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<li>pawns can move one step forward only. in case it is their first move, two steps forward are allowed. (see red arrows)</li>
			<li>pawns can hit other pieces diagonally (just one step allowed, see purple arrow).</li>
			<li><b>EN PASSANT MOVE: </b>if a pawn of the other player did a long starting move during the last turn and our pawn is next to it (left or right), 
			we can kill the other pawn. see situation in blue square: if the black pawn is doing an en passant move, he would land on the field with the blue flash. (this move can be disabled on the settings screen)</li>
			<li><b>PROMOTION: </b>if a pawn reaches the end of the board, it will become a queen.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>rooks</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_rooks.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<li>rooks can move/hit straight in any direction. multiple steps at once are allowed, if the passed way is free.</li>
			<li>rooks are also involved in the castling move. (see below)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>knights</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_knights.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<li>knights can move/hit one step diagonally plus one step straight (away from the current position). both part-steps account as one step.</li>
			<li>knights are actually the only pieces being able to leap over other pieces. (no matter which colour)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>bishops</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_bishops.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<<li>bishops can move/hit diagonally in any direction. multiple steps at once are allowed, if the passed way is free.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>queens</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_queens.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<li>queens can move/hit straight and diagonally in any direction. multiple steps at once are allowed, if the passed way is free.</li>
			<li>as you see the queen's got game, take care over her.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>kings</h3>
	<div class="halfbox">
		<img src="chess_screenshots_manual_kings.png" alt="start situation">
	</div>
	<div class="halfbox">
		
		<ul>
			<li>kings can move/hit straight and diagonally in any direction. just one step at once is allowed.</li>
			<li>if a king is in check, the according player is forced to get out of the check situation.</li>
			<li><b>CASTLING: </b>a king can do a castling move with a rook, as long as both of the pieces were never moved before and the way between is free.</br>
			a castling move can only be done if the king is not in check at the beginning or during the castling move.</br>
			a castling move has to be triggered by moving the king.</li>
		</ul>
